To tackle this problem, I focused on selecting the most appropriate data structure for efficiently storing and retrieving course information. Understanding data structures is crucial because they provide the foundation for organizing and managing data in a way that optimizes performance and resource usage. In this case, I chose a data structure that supported quick lookups and sorting, which was essential for efficiently handling the course data and providing a responsive user experience. I approached the problem by first breaking down the project requirements into smaller, manageable tasks, such as reading the file, implementing the menu, and handling specific user queries.

Throughout the project, I encountered several challenges, particularly with handling file input and ensuring that the data was correctly parsed and stored. One of the roadblocks was managing the alphanumeric sorting of course codes, as it required careful handling of both numeric and alphabetic components. To overcome these challenges, I revisited the project requirements, conducted research, and iterated on my code, testing different approaches until I found a solution that worked effectively. I also relied on debugging techniques to identify and fix errors as they arose.

Working on this project has significantly expanded my approach to software design and development. It reinforced the importance of choosing the right data structure for the task at hand and considering how user interactions and data management would affect the overall performance and usability of the program. I also gained a deeper appreciation for the role of pseudocode in planning and guiding the development process, as it helped ensure that my implementation stayed aligned with the projectâ€™s objectives.

Additionally, this project has evolved the way I write programs to be more maintainable, readable, and adaptable. I paid close attention to using meaningful variable names, in-line comments, and consistent formatting throughout my code. This not only made my code easier to read and understand but also ensured that it could be easily modified or extended in the future. By adhering to industry-standard best practices, I learned how important it is to write code that is not only functional but also clean and well-structured, which will be beneficial in my future software development endeavors.
